## Team Name: The Lighting Shark

## Project Name: Rating Movies website 

## Project Description:
Setup an application that focuses on software engineering best practices and configures DevOps related technologies such as Continuous Integration.

The focus is not on adding user features to this application, but on optimizing the development workflow, trying to incorporate as many software engineering best practices as possible.

For example, create a simple CRUD app (domain of the app is not important) that:

  -is deployed on https://heroku.com (or similar platforms)
  
  -uses a build system (e.g., Gradle) or a package manager (e.g., Composer for php), in which all dependencies are specified
  
  -has Continuous Integration that runs
  
  -static analysis (or linters) on the code
  
  -unit (or integration or system) tests
  
  -uses Pull-Requests for code reviews and Continuous Integration
  
  -has a logger, and a dashboard for analyzing the logs in real time for deployed applications
  
  -has git hooks:
  
    -that prevents commits that do not have traceability to issues (e.g., “Fixes #19”) from being pushed to the repository
    
    -that prevents source code that does not follow a specific code style from being committed and pushed to the repository
    
    -this requires the use of code style checkers that are run from the command line
    
    -etc.
    
  -etc.
  
Programming Languages: 
php, Java, Python, NodeJS, Ruby
